- **Chores Module**: Time-segmented chores (morning/midday/evening/any) with completion tracking and celebrations
- **Calendar Module**: Day/Week/Month views with profile color coding and navigation
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layouts for phones and tablets with proper touch targets
- **State Management**: Zustand store with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- **Navigation**: React Navigation with tab and stack navigation
- **Mock Data**: Pre-populated with sample profiles, events, chores, and lists

### ðŸš§ Future Enhancements
- **Schedule View**: List-style calendar view for comprehensive event overview
- **Event Detail Screens**: Full CRUD operations for events with recurrence editing
- **Chore Detail Screens**: Advanced chore management and creation
- **Profile Detail Screens**: Individual profile management and statistics

## Tech Stack

- **React Native** with Expo
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Zustand** for state management
- **React Navigation** for navigation
- **date-fns** for date handling
- **React Native Reanimated** for animations
- **ESLint & Prettier** for code quality

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or later)
- Expo CLI
- iOS Simulator or Android Emulator (or physical device)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Family-Sync
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

4. Run on your preferred platform:
```bash
npm run ios     # iOS Simulator
npm run android # Android Emulator
npm run web     # Web browser
```

## Development

### Code Quality
The project uses ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting:

```bash
npm run lint     # Check for linting errors
npm run lint:fix # Fix auto-fixable linting errors
```

### State Management
The app uses Zustand for state management with TypeScript interfaces. The store is located in `src/store/index.ts` and includes:

- Profile management (CRUD operations)
- Event management with recurrence support
- Chore management with completion tracking
- List and item management
- Filter and feature flag management

### Responsive Design
The app includes responsive utilities in `src/utils/helpers.ts`:

- `isTablet()`: Detects tablet devices
- `getResponsiveLayout()`: Returns layout configuration based on screen size
- Adaptive spacing, font sizes, and touch targets

## Mock Data

The app includes pre-populated mock data:

- **3 Profiles**: Jordan (parent, blue), Gemma (parent, green), EsmÃ© (child, orange)
- **Sample Events**: School runs, soccer practice, family movie night, weekend trip
- **Sample Chores**: Morning/evening routines, lawn mowing, dishes
- **Sample Lists**: Shopping, To-Dos, Holiday packing
